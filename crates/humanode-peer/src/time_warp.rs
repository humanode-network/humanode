//! Time warp mode logic.
//!
//! ## The issue's root cause.
//!
//! One invariant of BABE is that you have to produce at least one block every epoch_duration slots.
//! In case the network doesn't do it we get the following error during producing the block for
//! next epoch: "Import failed: Unexpected epoch change".
//!
//! ## Instruction to recover the network.
//!
//! 1. Extract the time of the last block that was finalized before the chain bricked (`FORK_TIMESTAMP`).
//!
//! 2. Revert the peer's data blocks to the latest finalized block by running `./humanode-peer revert`.
//!
//! 3. Define the time in the future when the warp is going to be started (i.e. most validators will be running).
//! In other words, it's `REVIVE_TIMESTAMP` (by default, timestamp of exact the peer binary run).
//!
//! 4. Define `WARP_FACTOR` that is going to be adopted to do time warp.
//!
//! 5. Run the peer in time warp mode by passing `--fork-timestamp`, `--revive-timestamp`, `--warp-factor`.
//!
//! 6. When the correct timestamp has been reached switch the peer to usual running mode.
