/// `RemovePallet` is a utility struct used to remove all storage items associated with a specific
/// pallet.
///
/// The implementation is based on [`frame_support::migrations::RemovePallet`], but doesn't focus
/// just on removing all storage items per one runtime upgrade in one block. Additionally, it allows
/// to use capabilities of `clear_prefix` with limit that can be used to partially delete a prefix
/// storage in case it is too large to delete in one block.
///
/// We are going to upstream improved logic to <https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk> when
/// we switched our substrate dependencies from archived substrate fork to polkadot-sdk fork.
