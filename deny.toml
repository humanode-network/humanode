  # A race condition at `remove_dir_all` crate. Used by `tempfile` crate, and

  #
  # Our main blocker here is `substrate`, which has it fixed in `master`.
  # At the time of writing substrate `master` is at `a9e85ae50d0efbf66f9a715af3b31bf37b884a6e`.
  #
  # We are ignoring this vulnerability for now, as it should be covered when
  # we update to the substrate that includes the bumped dependency.
  "RUSTSEC-2023-0018",
  # Root cause: chrono v0.4.23 (dependency of substrate/polkadot-v0.9.38).
  #
  # The vulnerability is in usage of vulnerable time library (v0.1.45).
  # Waiting the new release of chrono as current main branch doesn't depend on time library already.
