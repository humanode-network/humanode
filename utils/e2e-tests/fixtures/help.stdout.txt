            Shortcut for `--name Alice --validator` with session keys for `Alice` added to keystore

        --allow-private-ipv4
            Always accept connecting to private IPv4 addresses (as specified in
            [RFC1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918)). Enabled by default for chains marked as
            "local" in their chain specifications, or when `--dev` is passed

        --blocks-pruning <COUNT>
            Specify the number of finalized blocks to keep in the database.

            Default is to keep all blocks.

        --chain <CHAIN_SPEC>
            Specify the chain specification.

            It can be one of the predefined ones (dev, local, or staging) or it can be a path to a
            file with the chainspec (such as one exported by the `build-spec` subcommand).

        --charlie
            Shortcut for `--name Charlie --validator` with session keys for `Charlie` added to
            keystore

            Enable detailed log output.

            This includes displaying the log target, log level and thread name.

            This is automatically enabled when something is logged with any higher level than
            `info`.

        --dev
            Specify the development chain.

            This flag sets `--chain=dev`, `--force-authoring`, `--rpc-cors=all`, `--alice`, and
            `--tmp` flags, unless explicitly overridden.

        --disable-log-color
            Disable log color output

        --discover-local

            `Local`/`Development` and false otherwise.

        --enable-log-reloading
            Enable feature to dynamically update and reload the log filter.

            Be aware that enabling this feature can lead to a performance decrease up to factor six
            or more. Depending on the global logging level the performance decrease changes.

            The `system_addLogFilter` and `system_resetLogFilter` RPCs will have no effect with this
            option not being set.

        --enable-offchain-indexing <ENABLE_OFFCHAIN_INDEXING>

        --kademlia-disjoint-query-paths
            Require iterative Kademlia DHT queries to use disjoint paths for increased resiliency in
            the presence of potentially adversarial nodes.

            See the S/Kademlia paper for more information on the high level design as well as its
            security improvements.

            Sets a custom logging filter. Syntax is <target>=<level>, e.g. -lsync=debug.

            Log levels (least to most verbose) are error, warn, info, debug, and trace. By default,
            all targets log `info`. The global log level can be set with -l<level>.

        --listen-addr <LISTEN_ADDR>...
            Listen on this multiaddress.

            By default: If `--validator` is passed: `/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/<port>` and

            observer

        --no-mdns
            Disable mDNS discovery.

            By default, the network will use mDNS to discover other nodes on the local network. This
            disables it. Automatically implied when using --dev.

        --no-private-ipv4
            Always forbid connecting to private IPv4 addresses (as specified in
            [RFC1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918)), unless the address was passed with
            `--reserved-nodes` or `--bootnodes`. Enabled by default for chains marked as "live" in
            their chain specifications

        --no-prometheus
            Do not expose a Prometheus exporter endpoint.

            Prometheus metric endpoint is enabled by default.

        --no-telemetry
            Disable connecting to the Substrate telemetry server.

            Telemetry is on by default on global chains.

        --node-key <KEY>
            The secret key to use for libp2p networking.

            The value is a string that is parsed according to the choice of `--node-key-type` as
            follows:

            `ed25519`: The value is parsed as a hex-encoded Ed25519 32 byte secret key, i.e. 64 hex
            characters.

            The value of this option takes precedence over `--node-key-file`.

            WARNING: Secrets provided as command-line arguments are easily exposed. Use of this
            option should be limited to development and testing. To use an externally managed secret
            key, use `--node-key-file` instead.

        --node-key-file <FILE>
            The file from which to read the node's secret key to use for libp2p networking.

            The contents of the file are parsed according to the choice of `--node-key-type` as
            follows:

            `ed25519`: The file must contain an unencoded 32 byte or hex encoded Ed25519 secret key.

            If the file does not exist, it is created with a newly generated secret key of the
            chosen type.

        --node-key-type <TYPE>
            The type of secret key to use for libp2p networking.

            The secret key of the node is obtained as follows:

            * If the `--node-key` option is given, the value is parsed as a secret key according to
            the type. See the documentation for `--node-key`.

            * If the `--node-key-file` option is given, the secret key is read from the specified
            file. See the documentation for `--node-key-file`.

            * Otherwise, the secret key is read from a file with a predetermined, type-specific name
            from the chain-specific network config directory inside the base directory specified by
            `--base-dir`. If this file does not exist, it is created with a newly generated secret
            key of the chosen type.

            The node's secret key determines the corresponding public key and hence the node's peer
            ID in the context of libp2p.

            [default: ed25519]
            [possible values: ed25519]

        --offchain-worker <ENABLED>
            Should execute offchain workers on every block.

            By default it's only enabled for nodes that are authoring new blocks.

            seed

        --password-filename <PATH>
            File that contains the password used by the keystore

            Specify Prometheus exporter TCP Port

        --public-addr <PUBLIC_ADDR>...

            Specify a list of reserved node addresses

        --reserved-only
            Whether to only synchronize the chain with reserved nodes.

            Also disables automatic peer discovery.

            TCP connections might still be established with non-reserved nodes. In particular, if
            you are a validator your node might still connect to other validator nodes and collator
            nodes regardless of whether they are defined as reserved nodes.

        --robonode-url <ROBONODE_URL>
            The URL of robonode to authenticate with

        --rpc-cors <ORIGINS>
            Specify browser Origins allowed to access the HTTP & WS RPC servers.

            A comma-separated list of origins (protocol://domain or special `null` value). Value of
            `all` will disable origin validation. Default is to allow localhost and
            <https://polkadot.js.org> origins. When running in --dev mode the default is to allow
            all origins.

        --rpc-external
            Listen to all RPC interfaces.

            Default is local. Note: not all RPC methods are safe to be exposed publicly. Use an RPC
            proxy server to filter out dangerous methods. More details:
            <https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/build/custom-rpc/#public-rpcs>. Use
            `--unsafe-rpc-external` to suppress the warning if you understand the risks.

        --rpc-max-payload <RPC_MAX_PAYLOAD>
            DEPRECATED, this has no affect anymore. Use `rpc_max_request_size` or
            `rpc_max_response_size` instead

        --rpc-max-request-size <RPC_MAX_REQUEST_SIZE>
            Set the the maximum RPC request payload size for both HTTP and WS in megabytes. Default
            is 15MiB

            - `safe`: Exposes only a safe subset of RPC methods, denying unsafe RPC methods.
            - `auto`: Acts as `safe` if RPC is served externally, e.g. when `--{rpc,ws}-external` is
              passed, otherwise acts as `unsafe`.

            [default: auto]
            [possible values: auto, safe, unsafe]

        --rpc-port <PORT>
            Specify HTTP RPC server TCP port

            A temporary directory will be created to store the configuration and will be deleted at
            the end of the process.

            Note: the directory is random per process execution. This directory is used as base path
            which includes: database, node key and keystore.

            When `--dev` is given and no explicit `--base-path`, this option is implied.

        --tracing-receiver <RECEIVER>
            Receiver to process tracing messages

        --unsafe-pruning
            THIS IS A DEPRECATED CLI-ARGUMENT.

            It has been preserved in order to not break the compatibility with the existing scripts.
            Enabling this option will lead to a runtime warning. In future this option will be
            removed completely, thus specifying it will lead to a start up error.

            Details: <https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/8103>

        --unsafe-rpc-external
            Listen to all RPC interfaces.

            The node will be started with the authority role and actively participate in any
            consensus task that it can (e.g. depending on availability of local keys).

        --wasm-execution <METHOD>
            Method for executing Wasm runtime code

            [default: compiled]
            [possible values: interpreted-i-know-what-i-do, compiled]

        --wasm-runtime-overrides <PATH>
            Specify the path where local WASM runtimes are stored.

            These runtimes will override on-chain runtimes when the version matches.

        --wasmtime-instantiation-strategy <STRATEGY>
            The WASM instantiation method to use.

            Only has an effect when `wasm-execution` is set to `compiled`.

            The copy-on-write strategies are only supported on Linux. If the copy-on-write variant
            of a strategy is unsupported the executor will fall back to the non-CoW equivalent.

            The fastest (and the default) strategy available is `pooling-copy-on-write`.

            The `legacy-instance-reuse` strategy is deprecated and will be removed in the future. It
            should only be used in case of issues with the default instantiation strategy.

            [default: pooling-copy-on-write]
            [possible values: pooling-copy-on-write, recreate-instance-copy-on-write, pooling,
            recreate-instance, legacy-instance-reuse]

        --webapp-url <WEBAPP_URL>
            The URL to use for the web app. Used to print the QR Code to the console, so it doesn't
            matter much

        --ws-external
            Listen to all Websocket interfaces.

            Default is local. Note: not all RPC methods are safe to be exposed publicly. Use an RPC
            proxy server to filter out dangerous methods. More details:
            <https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/build/custom-rpc/#public-rpcs>. Use
            `--unsafe-ws-external` to suppress the warning if you understand the risks.

        --ws-max-connections <COUNT>
            Maximum number of WS RPC server connections

        --ws-max-out-buffer-capacity <WS_MAX_OUT_BUFFER_CAPACITY>
            DEPRECATED, this has no affect anymore. Use `rpc_max_response_size` instead

        --ws-port <PORT>
            Specify WebSockets RPC server TCP port
