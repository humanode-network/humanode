Benchmark the extrinsic weight of FRAME Pallets

Usage: humanode-peer benchmark pallet [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -p, --pallet <PALLET>
          Select a FRAME Pallet to benchmark, or `*` for all (in which case `extrinsic` must be `*`)

  -e, --extrinsic <EXTRINSIC>
          Select an extrinsic inside the pallet to benchmark, or `*` for all

  -s, --steps <STEPS>
          Select how many samples we should take across the variable components
          
          [default: 2]

      --low <LOWEST_RANGE_VALUES>
          Indicates lowest values for each of the component ranges

      --high <HIGHEST_RANGE_VALUES>
          Indicates highest values for each of the component ranges

  -r, --repeat <REPEAT>
          Select how many repetitions of this benchmark should run from within the wasm
          
          [default: 1]

      --external-repeat <EXTERNAL_REPEAT>
          Select how many repetitions of this benchmark should run from the client.
          
          NOTE: Using this alone may give slower results, but will afford you maximum Wasm memory.
          
          [default: 1]

      --json
          Print the raw results in JSON format

      --json-file <JSON_FILE>

      --no-median-slopes
          Don't print the median-slopes linear regression analysis

      --no-min-squares
          Don't print the min-squares linear regression analysis

          Manually override the hostname to use

      --hostname-fallback <HOSTNAME_FALLBACK>
          Specify a fallback hostname if no-one could be detected automatically.
          
          Note: This only exists to make the `hostname` function infallible.
          
          [default: <UNKNOWN>]

      --cpuname-fallback <CPUNAME_FALLBACK>
          Specify a fallback CPU name if no-one could be detected automatically.
          
          Note: This only exists to make the `cpuname` function infallible.
          
          [default: <UNKNOWN>]

      --output-analysis <OUTPUT_ANALYSIS>
          Which analysis function to use when outputting benchmarks: * min-squares (default) * median-slopes * max (max of min squares and median slopes for each value)

      --output-pov-analysis <OUTPUT_POV_ANALYSIS>
          Which analysis function to use when analyzing measured proof sizes
          
          [default: median-slopes]

      --default-pov-mode <DEFAULT_POV_MODE>
          The PoV estimation mode of a benchmark if no `pov_mode` attribute is present

          Possible values:
          - max-encoded-len: Use the maximal encoded length as provided by [`codec::MaxEncodedLen`]
          - measured:        Measure the accessed value size in the pallet benchmarking and add some trie overhead
          - ignored:         Do not estimate the PoV size for this storage item or benchmark
          
          [default: max-encoded-len]

      --heap-pages <HEAP_PAGES>
          Set the heap pages while running benchmarks. If not set, the default value from the client is used

      --no-verify
          Disable verification logic when running benchmarks

      --extra
          Display and run extra benchmarks that would otherwise not be needed for weight construction

      --chain <CHAIN_SPEC>
          Specify the chain specification.
          
          It can be one of the predefined ones (dev, local, or staging) or it can be a path to a file with the chainspec (such as one exported by the `build-spec` subcommand).

      --dev
          Specify the development chain.
          
          This flag sets `--chain=dev`, `--force-authoring`, `--rpc-cors=all`, `--alice`, and `--tmp` flags, unless explicitly overridden.

  -d, --base-path <PATH>
          Specify custom base path

  -l, --log <LOG_PATTERN>...
          Sets a custom logging filter (syntax: `<target>=<level>`).
          
          Log levels (least to most verbose) are `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, and `trace`.
          
          By default, all targets log `info`. The global log level can be set with `-l<level>`.
          
          Multiple `<target>=<level>` entries can be specified and separated by a comma.
          
          *Example*: `--log error,sync=debug,grandpa=warn`. Sets Global log level to `error`, sets `sync` target to debug and grandpa target to `warn`.

      --detailed-log-output
          Enable detailed log output.
          
          Includes displaying the log target, log level and thread name.
          
          This is automatically enabled when something is logged with any higher level than `info`.

      --disable-log-color
          Disable log color output

      --enable-log-reloading
          Enable feature to dynamically update and reload the log filter.
          
          Be aware that enabling this feature can lead to a performance decrease up to factor six or more. Depending on the global logging level the performance decrease changes.
          
          The `system_addLogFilter` and `system_resetLogFilter` RPCs will have no effect with this option not being set.

      --tracing-targets <TARGETS>
          Sets a custom profiling filter.
          
          Syntax is the same as for logging (`--log`).

      --tracing-receiver <RECEIVER>
          Receiver to process tracing messages

          Possible values:
          - log: Output the tracing records using the log
          
          [default: log]

      --execution <STRATEGY>
          The execution strategy that should be used for benchmarks

          Possible values:
          - native:           Execute with native build (if available, WebAssembly otherwise)
          - wasm:             Only execute with the WebAssembly build
          - both:             Execute with both native (where available) and WebAssembly builds
          - native-else-wasm: Execute with the native build if possible; if it fails, then execute with WebAssembly

      --wasm-execution <METHOD>
          Method for executing Wasm runtime code

          Possible values:
          - interpreted-i-know-what-i-do: Uses an interpreter which now is deprecated
          - compiled:                     Uses a compiled runtime
          
          [default: compiled]

      --wasm-instantiation-strategy <STRATEGY>
          The WASM instantiation method to use.
          
          Only has an effect when `wasm-execution` is set to `compiled`.

          Possible values:
          - pooling-copy-on-write:           Pool the instances to avoid initializing everything from scratch on each instantiation. Use copy-on-write memory when possible
          - recreate-instance-copy-on-write: Recreate the instance from scratch on every instantiation. Use copy-on-write memory when possible
          - pooling:                         Pool the instances to avoid initializing everything from scratch on each instantiation
          - recreate-instance:               Recreate the instance from scratch on every instantiation. Very slow
          - legacy-instance-reuse:           Legacy instance reuse mechanism. DEPRECATED. Will be removed in the future
          
          [default: pooling-copy-on-write]

      --db-cache <MiB>
          Limit the memory the database cache can use
          
          [default: 1024]

      --list
          List the benchmarks that match your query rather than running them.
          
          When nothing is provided, we list all benchmarks.

      --no-storage-info
          If enabled, the storage info is not displayed in the output next to the analysis.
          
          This is independent of the storage info appearing in the *output file*. Use a Handlebar template for that purpose.

      --map-size <WORST_CASE_MAP_VALUES>
          The assumed default maximum size of any `StorageMap`.
          
          When the maximum size of a map is not defined by the runtime developer, this value is used as a worst case scenario. It will affect the calculated worst case PoV size for accessing a value in a map, since the PoV will need to include the trie nodes down to the underlying value.
          
          [default: 1000000]

      --additional-trie-layers <ADDITIONAL_TRIE_LAYERS>
          Adjust the PoV estimation by adding additional trie layers to it.
          
          This should be set to `log16(n)` where `n` is the number of top-level storage items in the runtime, eg. `StorageMap`s and `StorageValue`s. A value of 2 to 3 is usually sufficient. Each layer will result in an additional 495 bytes PoV per distinct top-level access. Therefore multiple `StorageMap` accesses only suffer from this increase once. The exact number of storage items depends on the runtime and the deployed pallets.
          
          [default: 2]

      --json-input <JSON_INPUT>
          A path to a `.json` file with existing benchmark results generated with `--json` or `--json-file`. When specified the benchmarks are not actually executed, and the data for the analysis is read from this file

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
