Gets a public key and a SS58 address from the provided Secret URI

Usage: humanode-peer key inspect [OPTIONS] [URI]

Arguments:
  [URI]
          A Key URI to be inspected. May be a secret seed, secret URI (with derivation paths and password), SS58, public URI or a hex encoded public key. If it is a hex encoded public key, `--public` needs to be given as argument. If the given value is a file, the file content will be used as URI. If omitted, you will be prompted for the URI

Options:
      --public
          Is the given `uri` a hex encoded public key?

      --keystore-uri <KEYSTORE_URI>
          Specify custom URIs to connect to for keystore-services

      --keystore-path <PATH>
          Specify custom keystore path

      --password-interactive
          Use interactive shell for entering the password used by the keystore

      --password <PASSWORD>
          Password used by the keystore.
          
          This allows appending an extra user-defined secret to the seed.

      --password-filename <PATH>
          File that contains the password used by the keystore

  -n, --network <NETWORK>
          network address format

      --output-type <FORMAT>
          output format
          
          [default: text]

          Possible values:
          - json: Output as json
          - text: Output as text

      --scheme <SCHEME>
          cryptography scheme
          
          [default: sr25519]

          Possible values:
          - ed25519: Use ed25519
          - sr25519: Use sr25519
          - ecdsa:   Use

      --expect-public <EXPECT_PUBLIC>
          Expect that `--uri` has the given public key/account-id. If `--uri` has any derivations, the public key is checked against the base `uri`, i.e. the `uri` without any derivation applied. However, if `uri` has a password or there is one given by `--password`, it will be used to decrypt `uri` before comparing the public key/account-id. If there is no derivation in `--uri`, the public key will be checked against the public key of `--uri` directly

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
