Build a chain specification

Usage: humanode-peer build-spec [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --raw
          Force raw genesis storage output

      --disable-default-bootnode
          Disable adding the default bootnode to the specification. By default the `/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/30333/p2p/NODE_PEER_ID` bootnode is added to the specification when no bootnode exists

      --chain <CHAIN_SPEC>
          Specify the chain specification.
          
          It can be one of the predefined ones (dev, local, or staging) or it can be a path to a file with the chainspec (such as one exported by the `build-spec` subcommand).

      --dev
          Specify the development chain.
          
          This flag sets `--chain=dev`, `--force-authoring`, `--rpc-cors=all`, `--alice`, and `--tmp` flags, unless explicitly overridden.

  -d, --base-path <PATH>
          Specify custom base path

  -l, --log <LOG_PATTERN>...
          Sets a custom logging filter (syntax: `<target>=<level>`).
          
          Log levels (least to most verbose) are `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, and `trace`.
          
          By default, all targets log `info`. The global log level can be set with `-l<level>`.
          
          Multiple `<target>=<level>` entries can be specified and separated by a comma.
          
          *Example*: `--log error,sync=debug,grandpa=warn`. Sets Global log level to `error`, sets `sync` target to debug and grandpa target to `warn`.

      --detailed-log-output
          Enable detailed log output.
          
          Includes displaying the log target, log level and thread name.
          
          This is automatically enabled when something is logged with any higher level than `info`.

      --disable-log-color
          Disable log color output

      --enable-log-reloading
          Enable feature to dynamically update and reload the log filter.
          
          Be aware that enabling this feature can lead to a performance decrease up to factor six or more. Depending on the global logging level the performance decrease changes.
          
          The `system_addLogFilter` and `system_resetLogFilter` RPCs will have no effect with this option not being set.

      --tracing-targets <TARGETS>
          Sets a custom profiling filter.
          
          Syntax is the same as for logging (`--log`).

      --tracing-receiver <RECEIVER>
          Receiver to process tracing messages
          
          [default: log]

          Possible values:
          - log: Output the tracing records using the log

      --node-key <KEY>
          Secret key to use for p2p networking.
          
          The value is a string that is parsed according to the choice of `--node-key-type` as follows:
          
          - `ed25519`: the value is parsed as a hex-encoded Ed25519 32 byte secret key (64 hex chars)
          
          The value of this option takes precedence over `--node-key-file`.
          
          WARNING: Secrets provided as command-line arguments are easily exposed. Use of this option should be limited to development and testing. To use an externally managed secret key, use `--node-key-file` instead.

      --node-key-type <TYPE>
          Crypto primitive to use for p2p networking.
          
          The secret key of the node is obtained as follows:
          
          - If the `--node-key` option is given, the value is parsed as a secret key according to the type. See the documentation for `--node-key`.
          
          - If the `--node-key-file` option is given, the secret key is read from the specified file. See the documentation for `--node-key-file`.
          
          - Otherwise, the secret key is read from a file with a predetermined, type-specific name from the chain-specific network config directory inside the base directory specified by `--base-dir`. If this file does not exist, it is created with a newly generated secret key of the chosen type.
          
          The node's secret key determines the corresponding public key and hence the node's peer ID in the context of libp2p.
          
          [default: ed25519]

          Possible values:
          - ed25519: Use ed25519

      --node-key-file <FILE>
          File from which to read the node's secret key to use for p2p networking.
          
          The contents of the file are parsed according to the choice of `--node-key-type` as follows:
          
          - `ed25519`: the file must contain an unencoded 32 byte or hex encoded Ed25519 secret key.
          
          If the file does not exist, it is created with a newly generated secret key of the chosen type.
