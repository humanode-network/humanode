## About

Humanode is an innovative blockchain powered by Human biometrics to achieve Sybil-resistance.

Learn more at [humanode.io](https://humanode.io).

## Development

Humanode is written in Rust programming language and uses Substrate framework.

### Requirements

- Linux or macOS (no Windows support, sorry!)
- Rust programming language

### Building and running

Use the standard Rust tooling to work on the project: `cargo`!

To build and run the node (`humanode-peer`) in the local development mode, use `cargo run -- --dev`.

Use `cargo run --help` to see cargo options; use `cargo run -- --help` to see `humanode-peer` options.

### Contribution

1. Fork the repository, clone your fork, create a branch for your changes.
2. Write your code, commit the changes.
3. Create a pull request.
4. Tell us about your new contribution in the [chat](https://link.humanode.io/chat) (optional, but will speed up the process).
5. We will review and give you feedback on the PR; you will have to apply changes to your PR accordingly.
6. Once we are happy with the proposed changes we will merge your code into the main development branch.

Keep in mind we are just starting to accept public contributions, and our internal processes are not polished yet. Give us some slack, expect us to be busy with other stuff most of the time. Although, we will try as hard as we can to provide the feedback on the code asap!

Happy coding!
